# I-Wanna-Be-The-King-GMS2-Engine


I made this engine 100% from scratch, I tried to make it as similar to YoYo's physics as possible but
the physics were made from the ground up by me, platforms included (they were a pain)
So it's possible they have bugs I wasn't able to find

It also has support for IWPO integrated within the engine itself

I might still update this occasionally if I receive suggestions or bug reports

Also sorry for the lack of documentation! I need to work on that (hopefully)
