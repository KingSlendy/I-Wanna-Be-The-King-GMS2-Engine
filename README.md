# I-Wanna-Be-The-King-GMS2-Engine


This a game engine I tried to adapt to work without solids but trying to be as accurate as possible to Yuuutu physics
Everything was made entirely from scratch, but heavily based on YoYo's engine

It also has support for IWPO integrated within the engine itself

I might still update this occasionally if I receive suggestions or bug reports
If you have any please send them to me on my Discord: KingSlendy#6578

Also sorry for the lack of documentation! I need to work on that (hopefully)
